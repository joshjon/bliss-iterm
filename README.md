## About

Bliss inspires calmness and tranquil, whilst maintaining readability and visual distinction between elements. It is specifically designed with colors of high value (lightness) and low to intermediate saturation. As a result, the palette's tonal properties invoke a softer look that is easier on your eyes.

### Setting the Mood
Bliss looks even better with the following terminal setup:
* [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* [Bliss Oh My Zsh Theme](https://github.com/joshjon/bliss-zsh)
* [Bliss dircolors](https://github.com/joshjon/bliss-dircolors)

## Installation

1. Clone the Bliss iTerm repo to stay up to date or use the [download ZIP](https://github.com/joshjon/bliss-iterm/archive/master.zip) option and unzip the files.
2. Apply Bliss in iTerm through iTerm → preferences → profiles → colors → load presets.
